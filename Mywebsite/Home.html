            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>My Name is Favour Nwanna and I am a third-year computer engineering student at UofT specializing in 
                software engineering and computer networks. I am very interested in technology as well as business. 
                In particular, I am interested in exploring the intersection between business and technology, 
                so I intend to get a business and AI certificate upon graduation.</p>
